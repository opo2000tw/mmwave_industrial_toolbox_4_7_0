Quickstart
===========

The quickstart guide will cover setting up the EVM, flashing firmware, and running the demo.
By the end users should be able to visualize detected object data using the sensor and be able to begin evaluating different configurations and plot capabilities. 

## 1. Setup the EVM for Flashing Mode
Follow the instructions for [Hardware Setup of IWRXXXXBOOST for Flashing Mode](../../../common/docs/hardware_setup/hw_setup_boost_evm_for_flashing.html)


## 2. Flash the EVM using Uniflash
 
Flash the binary listed below using UniFlash. Follow the instructions for [using UniFlash](../../../common/docs/software_setup/using_uniflash_with_mmwave.html)
 
 BIN Name                 | Location    
--------------------------|------------
xwr18xx_mmw_demo_isk.bin      |  `<INDUSTRIAL_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\out_of_box_demo\`<br>`18xx_mmwave_sdk\prebuilt_binaries\isk\xwr18xx_mmw_demo.bin`

Note: The demo source code and pre-compiled binary for the mmWave SDK out-of-box demo is available at `<MMWAVE_SDK_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_sdk_<VER>\packages\ti\demo\xwr18xx\mmw`.
For convenience, the _exact same_ pre-compiled binary is also provided within the mmWave Industrial Toolbox at the path listed in the table above.

  
## 3. Setup the EVM for Functional Mode
Follow the instructions for [Hardware Setup of IWRXXXXBOOST for Functional Mode](../../../common/docs/hardware_setup/hw_setup_boost_evm_for_functional.html)

### 1. Software Requirements

 Tool                       | Version                   | Download Link    
----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------
  TI mmWave SDK             |  3.5.0.4                  | [Link to Latest mmWave SDK](http://software-dl.ti.com/ra-processors/esd/MMWAVE-SDK/latest/index_FDS.html) To access a previous version of the mmWave SDK scroll to the bottom of the table and click the link under "MMWAVE-SDK previous release". Repeat to continue stepping back to previous versions. 
  Code Composer Studio      |  8.3.1                    | [Code Composer Studio v8](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Download_CCS#Code_Composer_Studio_Version_8_Downloads)

### 2. Import Lab Project

To import the source code into your CCS workspace, CCS projects are provided for the mmWave SDK Out-of-box demo in the mmWave Industrial Toolbox. 
  
[[b! Project Workspace
When importing projects to a workspace, a copy is created in the workspace. It is important to note that the copy in the user's workspace is the one that gets built and all modifications will only be implemented for the workspace copy. The original project downloaded in mmWave Industrial Toolbox is not modified.
]]
  
- Start CCS and setup workspace as desired. 
- Import the project(s) specified below to CCS. See instructions for importing [here](../../../../docs/readme.html#import-ccs-projects-from-the-mmwave-industrial-toolbox-into-code-composer-studio)  

Project Name               | Location in Industrial Toolbox    
---------------------------|-----------------------------
mmwave_sdk_18xx_dss      | Do not import. Automatically imported with mss project.
mmwave_sdk_18xx_mss      | `<INDUSTRIAL_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\out_of_box_demo\18xx_mmwave_sdk\src`


- Verify that the import occurred without error: in CCS Project Explorer both **mmwave_sdk_18xx_dss** and **mmwave_sdk_18xx_mss** projects should appear.   

[[r! Error during Import to IDE
  If an error occurs, check that the software dependencies listed above have been installed. Errors will occur if necessary files are not installed in the correct location for importing. 
]] 
  


### 3. Build the Lab

1. Select the **mmwave_sdk_18xx_mss** so it is highlighted. Right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**. The DSS project will automatically build first and then the MSS project. 
2. On successful build, the following should appear:
	* In mmwave_sdk18xx_dss &rarr; isk, **xwr18xx_mmw_dss.xe674** (this is the C67x binary used for CCS debug mode) 
    * In mmwave_sdk18xx_mss &rarr; isk, **xwr18xx_mmw_mss.xer4f** (this is the Cortex R4F binary used for CCS debug mode) and **xwr18xx_mmw_demo.bin** (this is the flashable binary used for deployment mode) 

{{y Selecting Rebuild instead of Build ensures that the project is always re-compiled. This is especially important in case the previous build failed with errors.}}

[[r! Build Fails with Errors
If the build fails with errors, please ensure that all the software requirements are installed as listed above and in the mmWave SDK release notes.
]]

[[b! Note
As mentioned in the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section, pre-built binary files, both debug and deployment binaries are provided in the pre-compiled directory of the lab.
]]

### 4. Execute the Compiled Lab

There are two ways to execute the compiled code on the EVM:
* **Deployment mode**: In this mode, the EVM boots autonomously from flash and starts running the bin image
    * Use the **xwr18xx_mmw_demo.bin**  found at `<CCS_PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\mmwave_sdk_18xx_mss\isk\` and follow the same process in the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section except flash this binary instead.   
* **Debug mode**: This mode is is used for downloading and running the executable from CCS. This mode enables JTAG connection with CCS while the lab is running and is useful during development and debugging.
    * Follow the [CCS Debug Mode Guide](../../../common/docs/software_setup/using_ccs_debug.html), using the binaries listed below.
	 * After CCS Debug mode is setup, launch the visualizer and load a config as described in the [Run the Lab section of the Quickstart](#4-run-the-lab)  
	 
Debug binary   | Location | Connect and load to 
---------------|----------|----------------------
xwr18xx_mmw_mss.xer4f  |  `<CCS_PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\mmwave_sdk_18xx_mss\isk\`   | Cortex_R4_0
xwr18xx_mmw_dss.xe674  |  `<CCS_PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\mmwave_sdk_18xx_dss\isk\`   | C674X_0  
     
### 5. Output from mmWave Demo Visualizer and Output using DCA1000EVM
The mmWave Demo Visualizer is used to visualize processed output data from the mmWave radar device. This processed output data can be saved in binary form to a .DAT file. Additionally, raw ADC data can be saved for offline processing using the [DCA1000 EVM](https://www.ti.com/tool/DCA1000EVM).
To learn more about the structure of this output data please refer to the following resources:

[[b! Output Data versus Raw ADC Data
Output data refers to point cloud data (x,y,z,v). Raw ADC data refers to digitally sampled sensor data.

Work with GUI source code
-----------
This demo uses the mmWave Demo Visualizer which was created using GUI Composer. Users can import the GUI source code into the cloud version of GUI Composer to view and modify the source code as needed.
1. Open the mmWave Demo Visualizer: https://dev.ti.com/gallery/view/mmwave/mmWave_Demo_Visualizer/
2. In the upper top menu, go to Help &rarr; Download or Clone Visualizer
3. Click on the import to GUI Composer icon.  <img src="../../common/docs/images/gui/import_to_gc_icon.png"/>
4. The mmWave_Demo_Visualizer project and its source code should now be visible within GUI composer.

A quick overview of the mmWave Demo Visualizer specific files follows:
  * mmWave.js: Main file that communicates with the GUI composer framework, communicates to the mmWave device using the configured COM ports, processes GUI-generated actions, and plots the data generated by the mmWave device
  * input_validations.js: validates the CLI configuration before it is sent to the mmWave device
  * dynamic_tuning.js: implementation of "real time tuning" tab and "advanced commands" tab
  * input.js: Handles all the backend computations behind the CONFIGURE tab
  * Index.gui: Auto-generated file that handles the layout of the Visualizer app
  * Helper utilities: Delaunay.js, fft.js, math.js, math_griddata.js, and myutil.js
